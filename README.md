# SNAP Prescreen Calculator

This is a project which is joint with @trevorsummerssmith and @khwilson put
together for the 
[Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty](http://www.metcouncil.org). The goal
was to build a simple application that volunteers could carry around while
prescreening people for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

## Usage

Right now, this is just a static website, so you can simply upload the contents
of the html folder to your favorite web host and call it a day.

This repo currently contains an app.yaml ready to deploy to Google's App
Engine. As it is a static site it has no actual ties to App Engine, other than
its app.yaml.

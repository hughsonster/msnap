# SNAP Prescreen Calculator

This is a project which is joint with @trevorsummerssmith and @khwilson put
together for the 
[Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty](http://www.metcouncil.org). The goal
was to build a simple application that volunteers could carry around while
prescreening people for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
